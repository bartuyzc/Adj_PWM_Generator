# Project Structure
## Top Level
In this top level design, we connect the debouncing filter to the inputs, however, I do not suggest to connect it for behavioral simulations. It affects the results non-accurately.

## PWM Generator
Simulate this module for better and accurate results.

- `inc_duty` / `dec_duty`: Changes the duty time duration by changing `ACTIVE` register. Step size is 5%.
- `inc_freq` / `dec_freq`: Manages the changes with selecting period values from look-up-table. Step size is approximately 100 KHz.  
  (When we reach the higher frequencies, our sensitivity faces some scaling issues due to the fact that changes become roughly 100 KHz.)
- `mode_select`:  
  `0`: edge-aligned / `1`: center-aligned
- `rst`: The design uses a common reset signal for each module, which drives the outputs to `'0'`.
- `clk`: This one is also common for the system, and Iâ€™ve chosen 40 ns for the operating period.

## Debouncing Filter
You can also change the divisor parameter that included in clk_divider.v file.
